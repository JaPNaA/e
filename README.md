# japnaa.github.io/e

This repository is for external 3rd party resources I use

This allows for easier updates thoughout all of my sites/projects, shared files (less space), and with a shorter url.

Why did I call it *e*? "e" stand for ***e**xternal*....
and the name had to be short.

okay, so can you leave now?
